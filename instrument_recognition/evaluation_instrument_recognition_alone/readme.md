# In this folder we should have evaluation notebooks of each model  (juust recognition part)

# Notes

- In this repo ./models --> Is where all models are ; replace the path to run the results
- this is an evaluation of juust the recognition part (assuming implicitly onsets are perfectly magically detected)
- There is still some source of minimal uncontrolled randomness (perma dropout mb) but you should still get to the 
same or almost the same results (changes must be minimal ).

# TODOs

- Create an easy pipeline preprocessor, so you dont need to preprocess in one notebook and evaluate on the other one.
